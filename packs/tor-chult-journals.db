For examples using such walls on the step pyramids could be done to great effect. However I have omitted these, as I think for most users, without setting them up yourself, it would end up being very confusing to run out of the box.</p><p>The exception to this is the East Dorm, where I put one set of landscape wall in that would prevent sight around the pyramid at ground level. Please review the walls, and make your choices regarding how you want those walls set up!</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":200000,"name":"Introduction","type":"text","_id":"tyMeuVK3PHijq8tR","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Welcome to Tor's Chult!
